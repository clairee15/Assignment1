# Centimillimental Broadcast
My project is to advertise this soloist called Atsushi. The website is used to display his work and himself. This is so that he is able to sell his music and build his career further, not just limited to Japan. I would like to sell more of his merchandise and getting more gigs/concerts.

## Design Process
This website is for Centimillimental and the main purpose is to make this soloist known to the world. I would like to build a bigger platform for him in the music industry. My project soley focuses on his music so that more people would recognise his work. 

## Features
There is a navigation bar at the top, where users can navigate by pressing on them for each page. Each button will bring them to different pages.
Next up, on the home page, there would be a brief description of the artist that I am advertising and a video is also attached so that users can view his latest music video. The artist's social media is attached and at the bottom, users can fill up the form to stay updated on news related to the artist. 

Next, there is a media page.

Next, there is a merchandise page. The artists has merchandise such as clothes, albums, etc. There is a photo gallery that has the albums' photo cover and some brief description about the album. Scrolling down, there will be photographs of the merchandises and their individual pricing.
