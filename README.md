# Centimillimental Broadcast
My project is to advertise this soloist called Atsushi. The website is used to display his work and himself. This is so that he is able to sell his music and build his career further, not just limited to Japan. I would like to sell more of his merchandise and getting more gigs/concerts.

## Design Process
This website is for Centimillimental and the main purpose is to make this soloist known to the world. I would like to build a bigger platform for him in the music industry. My project soley focuses on his music so that more people would recognise his work. 

## Features
There is a navigation bar at the top, where users can navigate by pressing on them. Each button will bring them to different pages.
Next up would be a brief description of the artist that I am advertising and a video is also attached so that users can view his latest music video.
